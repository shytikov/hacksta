## The story

Oops I did it again... After [condensing Cascadia Code](https://github.com/shytikov/casmatapro), which worked so well for me, I decided to try it once more, now with [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack).

Hack is notoriously boring, and intentionally average looking. You cannot say anythig exceptionally good about it, except the fact, you cannot find anything bad.

It's a workhorse of a font, that does its job in any situation. And now even in more compact form!

## Installation
